import UIKit


//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String, wordB: String) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: the wordA passed in is a String optional, while the instance variable wordA is just an implicitly unwrapped optional String. If wordA is used while it has a value of nil, an error will arise.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    static func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: let makes the variable constant which forces the value to stay the same, incrementing is not allowed, so I made it a var. Also, you must return true at the very end.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]()
        var lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        var lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: The function should be static because you are not using instance variables and it is being called without an instance of the class, using just the Class name. Make sure to return true at the very end because the method does not return an optional, it returns a boolean value that is either true or false.
